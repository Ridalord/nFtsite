## My process
I started building the site by completing the html markup, and adding som div tags. Then I created an external CSS stylesheet for styling the site starting with the mobile approach. Using the created div elements I was able to style the sections of the pages by add colors, flexbox, font styles and other relevant styling where necessary. 
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
While working on this project i was able to learn how to style eusing the absolute position attribute where i had to add the view icon to the equilibrium image.


### Continued development

I want to focus on the use of CSS grids and flexbox in future projects. I intend on designing prjects with user friendly animation that are well responsive.
